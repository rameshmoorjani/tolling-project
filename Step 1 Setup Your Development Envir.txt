Step 1: Setup Your Development Environment
1. Install Python and Node.js
Install Python 3.8+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Node.js (which includes npm) from https://nodejs.org/

2. Create project folders
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir tolling-project
cd tolling-project
mkdir backend frontend data
Step 2: Prepare Python Backend Environment
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Activate venv:
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
2. Install backend dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install fastapi uvicorn tensorflow numpy pydantic python-multipart opencv-python
3. Create main FastAPI file
Create main.py in backend folder with a minimal FastAPI app (you can expand later):

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Tolling API is running"}
4. Run backend server
bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
Open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to test.

Step 3: Prepare Frontend Environment
1. Initialize React + TypeScript app
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
npx create-react-app . --template typescript
2. Start React development server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to verify.

Step 4: Download and Explore KITTI Dataset
1. Download KITTI training data
Go to http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/

Download the "Object Detection" training images and labels

2. Explore dataset structure
Images folder contains raw images

Labels folder contains text files with bounding boxes and classes

Step 5: Prepare Data for Model Training
1. Parse KITTI labels
Write a Python script to read label files, extract vehicle annotations (car, truck, cyclist), and crop vehicle images if needed.

2. Split data
Split images and labels into training (80%) and validation (20%) folders.

Step 6: Train Vehicle Classification Model
1. Build a simple TensorFlow CNN
Resize and normalize images

Create CNN or use transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2)

2. Train and validate model
Save model as vehicle_classifier.

Step 7: Integrate Model into FastAPI Backend
1. Load saved model in FastAPI main.py
2. Create /predict POST endpoint
Accept image uploads or base64 images

Preprocess input and run prediction

Return predicted vehicle class JSON response

Step 8: Connect React Frontend with Backend API
1. Build a form for image upload
2. Call /predict API on submit
3. Display prediction result on the page
Step 9: Implement Toll Pricing Logic and Payment Integration
1. Create toll pricing rules based on vehicle type
2. Add payment gateway sandbox integration (Stripe or PayPal)
3. Add UI components to handle payments
Step 10: Test, Refine, and Deploy
1. Test all flows end-to-end locally
2. Write unit and integration tests
3. Deploy backend and frontend on cloud platforms
